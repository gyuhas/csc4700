I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
And, see what there is to see
Time is just a melody
With all the people in the street
Walk as fast as their feet can take them
I just roll through town
And though my window's got a view
Well the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for now
So for now I...

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down

This engine screams out loud
Centipede gonna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
'Cause it's gonna sting me when I leave this town
And all the people in the street
That I'll never get to meet
If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time
That I got to get to
Where I don't need to be
So I

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now
Let me break on down

But you can't stop nothing
If you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind
That you kept and you know
You don't know nothing
But you don't need to know
The wisdom's in the trees
Not the glass windows
You can't stop wishing
If you don't let go
The things that you find
And you lose, and you know
You keep on rolling
Put the moment on hold
The frame's too bright
So put the blinds down low

I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I need this
Old train to break down
Oh please just
Let me please break down
I wanna break on down
But I can't stop now
